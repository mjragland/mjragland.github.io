				<h3 class="subhead">Translation</h3>
				<p>Wordwise provides translation and localization services in all major European languages as well as Chinese and Japanese. As you can tell, we need to hire a copywriter.</p>
				<p>We specialize in the following fields:</p>
					<div id="list">
						<ul>
							<li>Technical documentation</li>
							<li>Marketing</li>
							<li>Business correspondence</li>
							<li>Natural Sciences</li>
							<li>Information Technology</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

			<div class="copy">
				<h3 class="subhead">Proofreading</h3>
				<p>Maybe you have already had a document translated, but you're not sure about its quality. Or perhaps you or colleagues have written correspondence that needs a critical eye to review it. Send it to us. We'll make sure it's in top form before you publish or send it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="copy">
				<h3 class="subhead">ESL</h3>
				<p>A number of our international clients have to speak and write regularly in English, and some of them seek guidance when expressing themselves in a second language. We'e there to help. We arrange private and group sessions with clients to ensure that they deliver the message they intend to, whether it's a matter of writing e-mails, doctoral theses, or anything in between.</p>
